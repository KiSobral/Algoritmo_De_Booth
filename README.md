# Booth Algorithm
An implementation of booth algorithm in assembly mips. (The comments in code are all in brazilian portuguese, so if you are a portuguese speaker: vá em frente e disfrute para entender sobre o algoritmo de Booth).
This code uses assembly mips32.

## Purpose
This repository was made to contribute to those who want to know more about assembly algorithms and share knowledge about assembly implementations.

## Material used in 
This algorithm was made with the notes stored in this [repository about computers architectures](https://github.com/LeoSilvaGomes/Fac/)   
[Note wich contains the booth algorithm](https://github.com/LeoSilvaGomes/Fac/blob/master/aula-10.md) 

___
Os materiais usados e o código são feitos em **portugês brasileiro**.
The notes and codes was made in **brazilian portuguese**.
